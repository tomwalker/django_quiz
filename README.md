Django quiz app
===============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomwalker/django_quiz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomwalker/django_quiz)

This is a configurable quiz app for Django.

I use it to run a few medical revision websites. Here is an [example website](http://www.revisemrcp.com/)

My websites have used twitter bootstrap for the front end and I have tried to strip out anything from
the template files that are dependant on bootstrap.
